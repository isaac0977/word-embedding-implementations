For the BERT evaluation, I've created copies of the initial evaluation functions as <eval_function>_bert(). These BERT functions will run if the string "BERT" is passed when running the evaluation script. 

For the BERT embeddings, I'm using the single CLS token for the sentence embeddings.
For the word level embedding, I'm ignoring the first CLS and last SEP tokens, adding the remianing vectors and taking the average.
